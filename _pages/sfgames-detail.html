The emergence and evolution of 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), has pushed researchers and industries to be looking at the technological transformation to move towards an environment, where multiple devices will be able to connect, share information, interpret, and deliver a seamless experience for users. Despite the fact that significant advances have been realized through the use of enhanced network architectures and technologies, large amounts of spectrum – being a scarce resource - are still required to deliver massive increases in capacity and achieve high throughput. Unless a paradigm shift
occurs in the resource allocation decision making process the problem of spectral efficiency will still remain a barrier towards the realization of 5G’s full potential.

            <p>
Traditionally, towards devising intelligent resource allocation approaches in such resource constrained environments, the Expected Utility Theory (EUT) has been adopted targeting at the maximization of the users’ benefits from allocating the
available resources. Following the principles of EUT, each user aims at maximizing its personal utility in a selfish manner targeting at the highest possible performance. Moreover, to enable the users’ distributed intelligent decision making in a computationally efficient manner, while at the same time capturing the users’ competitive behavioral patterns, Game Theory has arisen as a theoretical and practical powerful tool. The solution of the corresponding resource
orchestration problems is the Nash Equilibrium (NE) point, where the users maximize their own utility, while they cannot achieve a better outcome by unilaterally changing their own strategies given the strategies of the rest of the users.</p>

        <p>
However, is the NE point really the best solution that it can be achieved by the users, in communications and computing systems where users’ decision are interdependent?
Even more, is the goal of maximizing each user’s utility a reasonable and meaningful goal within such resource constrained systems? Those are the fundamental questions that this thrust aims to address, while introducing a novel efficient resource
control framework based on the theory of Satisfaction Games.            </p>
