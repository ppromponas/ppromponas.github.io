            Future wireless networks, such as 5G/6G systems, must support growing demands for high data rates and broad coverage. Sectorization — equipping infrastructure nodes with multiple directional sectors — is a promising solution to improve spatial reuse and reduce interference. Sectorized wireless backhaul networks, particularly in mmWave frequencies, can deliver fiber-like speeds using beam-steering phased arrays within each sector. Recent developments, such as IAB and SuperCell, highlight the importance of designing and optimizing sectorized nodes capable of activating multiple sectors simultaneously.

            <p>
            In this work, we model and analyze sectorized multi-hop mesh networks, where each fixed node consists of several independently steerable sectors. We define the link interference model and characterize the capacity region based on the network topology and sector configuration. We introduce the flow extension ratio and sectorization gain to quantify the performance benefits of sectorized designs. Our goal is to determine the node sectorization that maximizes flow under given network conditions.

            <p>
            We formulate the optimization problem for selecting sectorizations and propose a distributed algorithm with a 2/3 approximation guarantee. We also identify a class of Even Homogeneous Sectorizations that improves dynamic routing and boosts capacity. Furthermore, we explore dynamic sectorization strategies using backpressure and b-matching-based routing, achieving robust performance under unknown traffic arrivals. Our evaluation demonstrates significant sectorization gains across a variety of network settings.
